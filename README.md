# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning

In this project, I have done Plant Disease Detection using ResNet-50 with accuracy of 99%. 
The dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lavaman151/plantifydr-dataset 

Further, I have done comparison of ResNet-50 and VGG-16 in another plant dataset where I concluded that ResNet-50 is more accurate than VGG-16. 
I have published a research paper under this comparison named "*Decoding Plant Diseases: Unleashing the Power of ResNet-50 for Superior Disease Detection*"
